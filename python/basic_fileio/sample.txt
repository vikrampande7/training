Conserve water, conserve life.
You never know the worth of water until the well runs dry.
Save water, and it will save you.
Don’t let life slip down the drain.
How many drops make up an ocean? Conserve water; every drop counts.
Don’t lush our planet’s most valuable resource.
It takes a lot of blue to stay green.
If we don’t learn to conserve, we’ll all be fish out of water.
Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink.
A drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold to a thirsty man.
Water Smarter!
